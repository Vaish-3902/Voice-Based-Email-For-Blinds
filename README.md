# Voice-Based-Email-For-Blinds
 
The project is a python-based application for visually impaired persons using speech to text 
voice response, thus enabling everyone to control their mail accounts using their voice only 
and to be able to read, send, and perform all the other useful tasks.

## Technologies Used

### Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) 
ASR technology is used to convert spoken language into text. It is a crucial component in voice based email systems, as it allows the system to understand and transcribe spoken words into text that can be processed further. 
 
### Text-to-Speech (TTS): 
TTS technology converts text into spoken words. It is a fundamental component in voice-based email systems for delivering email content to users in a natural and intelligible voice. 

 
### Machine Learning: 
Machine Learning is used to train models for speech recognition, language understanding, and other tasks. It enables the system to improve its accuracy over time by learning 
from user interactions and feedback. 
 
### Accessibility APIs: 
Accessibility APIs help in integrating voice-based email applications with screen readers and other assistive technologies. This ensures that the application is compatible with existing accessibility tools used by individuals with visual impairments. 
 
### Voice Assistants Integration: 
Integrating with popular voice assistant platforms allows users to access voice-based email functionalities through their preferred voice assistant, enhancing the overall user experience. 
 
### Security Features: 
Security features such as voice biometrics can be implemented to enhance user authentication. Additionally, encryption ensures the privacy and security of sensitive email content. 
  
 
 ### To run the project, execute the following commands: 
>cd voice_based_email 
>cd mysite 
>python manage.py runserver

## Future Enhancements
### Multi-language Support: 
Incorporate support for multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base. 
 
### Natural Language Processing (NLP): 
Integrate advanced NLP algorithms to improve the system's ability to understand and respond to natural language queries and commands. 
 
### Voice Authentication: 
Implement secure voice authentication mechanisms to ensure the privacy and security of user 
emails. 
 
### Interactive Voice Commands: 
Enable users to perform actions within emails using voice commands (eg., reply, forward, delete) to enhance hands-free usability. 
 
 
### Automatic Email Summarization: 
Develop a summarization feature that provides concise verbal summaries of lengthy emails, helping users quickly grasp the main points. 
 
### Integration with Voice Assistants: 
Integrate with popular voice assistants (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant) for seamless control and interaction.
